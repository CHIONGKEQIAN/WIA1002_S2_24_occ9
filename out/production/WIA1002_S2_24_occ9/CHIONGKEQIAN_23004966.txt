My name is Chiong Ke Qian with matric number, 23004966. I am majoring in Computer System and Networking. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this subject. This is because it is a very challenging subject for me.

I acquired C for my previous programming 1 course. Itâ€™s vey bad. So, I think I can manage to get C for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in this subject, I will study hard in this semester. Wish me luck!!!
